Receipts are retained without a time expiry; replay uses the same application, subject, game and key. Timeouts, malformed success and server errors have unknown outcome: retain the original key and body. No Discord control fields, results, role management, passwords, publication or two-team score inference are accepted. Match team assignments: event.matchTeams lists directory team IDs with slot (a, b; c for Wardogs) and nullable side; Logi captures each team's name, short code and logo when first selected and never accepts client snapshots. Omitting matchTeams preserves the saved selection, an explicit [] clears it, and concluded matches keep their assignments. The refresh_match_team operation re-captures one assigned team's presentation (name, short code, logo, team revision) from its active directory entry. It is audited and follows the same expectedRevision and idempotency receipt rules as an update, but stays available after meeting start until the match concludes; a concluded match or a training returns invalid_match_teams.`,
