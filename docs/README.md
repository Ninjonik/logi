# Technical documentation

Maintenance planning: [codebase review](codebase-review-2026-11-11.md) and [implementation handoff](maintenance-implementation-plan.md).

Bot release candidate: [validation and release boundary](maintenance/discord-bot-release-readiness.md) and [implementation progress / remaining TODOs](maintenance/discord-bot-implementation-progress.md).

Completed bot source/test review: [performance audit](maintenance/discord-bot-performance-audit.md), [complete bot remediation plan](maintenance/discord-bot-implementation-plan.md), and [file coverage ledger](maintenance/discord-bot-review-ledger.json). Runtime performance acceptance remains implementation work.

Review evidence: [scope and limitations](maintenance/audit-scope.md), [deeper findings](maintenance/audit-progress.md), [performance and caching](maintenance/performance-and-caching-audit.md), and [API parity work register](maintenance/api-parity-audit.md). Static coverage and manual review depth are distinguished explicitly.

Logi's documentation is organized by audience and runtime:

The API serves its interactive reference at `/api/v1/docs` and OpenAPI schema at `/api/v1/openapi.json`. JSON examples and provider captures retained beside integration references support contract and parser tests.

[GitHub issue synchronization](github-issues.md) covers optional bug-report export, status synchronization, and signed webhooks.
