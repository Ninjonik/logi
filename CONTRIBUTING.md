# Contributing

## Principles

Contributions should move the codebase toward:

- isolated business logic
- smaller framework entrypoints
- explicit domain boundaries
- test coverage around edge cases

Avoid adding new business behavior directly into:

- `convex/*.ts`
- `src/app/api/**`
- `discord-bot/src/interactions.ts`

unless the behavior is truly adapter-specific.

## Before You Change Code

Identify which kind of change you are making:

- UI-only change
- domain rule change
- workflow/use-case change
- integration or adapter change

Then edit the correct layer first.

## Expected Workflow

1. Add or update tests first when touching business rules.
2. Keep domain modules pure.
3. Keep use-cases explicit and narrow.
4. Keep Convex, web routes, and Discord handlers thin.
5. Run tests and typecheck before finishing.

## Testing Commands

```bash
npm run test
npm run test:domain
npm run bot:test
npm run typecheck
```

## Where To Put Code

### Business rules

Put them in `src/domain/<module>`.

Examples:

- state transitions
- validations
- policy decisions
- derived statuses

### Workflows

Put them in `src/application/<module>`.

Examples:

- loading several aggregates
- calling multiple repositories
- deciding save order

### Adapters

Put them in:

- `convex/` for Convex entrypoints
- `discord-bot/` for bot runtime handlers
- `src/app` and `src/lib` for web-facing integration
- `src/infrastructure` for reusable implementations and fakes

## Testing Expectations

For business changes, include tests for:

- normal flow
- invalid flow
- edge cases
- regression cases you are fixing

If a piece of code is hard to test, that is usually a sign it belongs in a different layer.

## Refactor Guidance

If you touch older framework-heavy code:

1. avoid expanding the old pattern
2. extract the rule into `src/domain` if practical
3. let the old file delegate to the new rule

Incremental migration is preferred over big rewrites.

## Current Runtime Split

- `src/domain` owns pure rules such as event state, signup rules, roster sync, attendance transitions, and score calculation.
- `src/application` owns workflows such as event upsert/conclude/reconcile, roster upsert, roster attendance updates, assignment changes, and Discord sync payload shaping.
- `src/infrastructure/convex` owns repository implementations for those use-cases.
- Focused Convex read modules such as `convex/serverContext.ts`, `convex/serverMetadata.ts`, `convex/serverRosters.ts`, and `convex/users.ts` should stay feature-scoped.
- `convex/*.ts` should validate input, create repositories/use-cases, and persist adapter-specific results.
- `discord-bot/src/*.ts` should parse Discord events, call Convex or shared modules, and render Discord output.

## Read Models And Gateways

- Add Next.js read access through `src/lib/read-models/*`.
- Add write-side web integration through `src/lib/gateways/*`.
- Avoid adding new grab-bag `server-*` modules. If a compatibility wrapper is needed, keep it thin and re-export from a focused read-model or gateway.

## Testing Placement

- Put pure rule tests next to the domain module.
- Put orchestration tests next to the use-case in `src/application`.
- Put adapter and normalization tests in `src/infrastructure` when mapping is the risk.
- Add integration tests only for important runtime wiring paths.

## Current Exception

- No intentional compatibility shim should be preserved just to keep an old Convex module namespace alive. Update the callers instead.

## Notes For Frontend Changes

Frontend components should:

- stay focused on rendering and user interaction
- call routes or server helpers for side effects
- avoid carrying hidden business logic

If a component needs complicated rule logic, move that logic into a domain or application module first.

## Notes For Discord Bot Changes

Bot handlers should:

- parse Discord interactions
- call Convex or shared logic
- render Discord-specific output

Do not embed general signup or roster rules directly in handlers if the dashboard or Convex layer also depends on them.
