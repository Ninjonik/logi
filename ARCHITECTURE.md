# Architecture

Logi has three cooperating runtimes: a Next.js App Router dashboard and public site in `src/app`, Convex functions and persistence in `convex`, and a Discord.js bot in `discord-bot`.

## Layers

Domain modules are independent of React, Next.js, Convex, Discord.js, environment variables, and persistence clients. Application workflows receive persistence and external capabilities through ports. Convex owns database transactions, including the reads and writes performed by repository adapters.

Feature modules cover events, rosters, assignments, membership, identity, teams, competitions, game data, results, Discord publications, seeding, and integrations. The directory tree contains the full module inventory; features share domain/application behavior across runtimes.

## Runtime communication

The dashboard reads through Convex-backed read models and HTTP adapters, and writes through authenticated gateways. Client interactivity lives in React components; shared decisions live in domain or application modules.

Convex functions validate their inputs and authenticate through an internal secret, a dashboard-session gateway, or a scoped integration grant. Browser-supplied user IDs do not establish authority. Queries and mutations retain workspace and game scoping.

The bot calls Convex through `discord-bot/src/convex.ts`. Its workers coordinate announcements, rosters, panels, reminders, applications, tickets, roles, and League tracking. Discord payloads and network effects live in the bot; shared policy lives in `src/domain` and `src/application`.

## Identity and access

Discord OAuth creates durable dashboard sessions in Convex. Session validation checks current identity, expiry, and revocation. Optional OIDC uses its own protocol routes and registered clients; bearer integration keys cannot create login sessions.

The personal league boundary `/api/v1/me/leagues` instead requires the live
first-party account session and same-origin validation for writes. Basic league
profiles are account-owned catalogue teams, with private invitation membership
and fixture score reports in separate league tables. Clan service keys and
clan-scoped SSO actors cannot grant global personal-team ownership. Connected
fixture hosts retain their clan's server-management authority; external hosts
never accept imported statistics.

The `/api/v1` surface uses scoped integration keys and, for actor-backed operations, current actor authorization. Public presentation, verified platform identity, membership evidence, and authorization are separate concerns. See the [integration reference](docs/integrations/website/README.md).

## Convex hot paths

Frequently called reads use indexed lookups and bounded pages. Large payloads are stored separately from leases and counters: live cache status lives in `hllLiveCache` and `warconReadCache`, while provider data lives in their payload tables. Unchanged payloads are not rewritten on every refresh.

Collectors run from crons. History collection performs bounded steps and stops incremental scans at already-complete sessions. Discord membership reconciliation uses current observations, bounded retries, and periodic refresh; unchanged observations do not create a new logical membership change.

Request authentication uses queries. Process-local limits and throttled usage writes avoid per-request contention on shared documents. `/api/v1/clan/meta` serves `clanMetaSummaries`; missing summaries are computed synchronously, while stale summaries refresh off the request path at most once per minute.

The changes endpoint accepts `start=now` for a boundary; replaying a cursor returns `410 reset_required`, so consumers rebuild their scoped resources. There is no persistent integration change log. Revisions and queued webhooks signal relevant projection changes.

Housekeeping prunes expired idempotency records, rate-limit buckets, completed delivery work, and other bounded history through expiry indexes. Game history follows its configured retention. Match statistics, result revisions, and recaps have their own persistence lifecycles.

Convex module size affects isolate startup. Read-only modules keep validation schemas and write workflows outside their runtime graph where possible. Pure projections and runtime schemas have separate modules. Stored structured fields are validated on write; JSON payload readers use focused guards.

Panel publication and heartbeat writes are throttled and compare served state before writing. Tests in `src/infrastructure/convex` cover indexed reads, lease patches, projection changes, and retention behavior. Self-hosted configuration is documented in [self-hosting](docs/self-hosting.md).

## Tests and documentation

Colocated `*.test.ts` files use `node:test` and `node:assert` through `tsx`. Domain tests exercise pure behavior; application tests exercise workflows through fakes; adapter tests cover mapping, authorization, and runtime wiring.
